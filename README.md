### Self-introduction

- 🎨 I'm a passionate Machine Learning Engineer with a strong background in data statistics.
- 🤖 Deeply interested in LLM applications, currently studying about hallucination
- 🛠 Created various open-source libraries:
  - [ThreatLens](https://github.com/pxxguin/Development_of_an_Anomaly_Detection_System) - An anomaly detection system built on the NSL-KDD dataset. Classifies network traffic into normal vs. abnormal (e.g., DDoS, scans), with model explainability (ELI5, Alibi) and Django-based web interface for real-time threat monitoring.

  - [Autofic](https://github.com/AutoFiC) - A system that automatically detects security vulnerabilities in code, applies patches, and generates PR for seamless integration [📑 Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R3YJRcVCDjqAKCcpQp3u2JyK1ouGf0w6/view?usp=sharing) & [📊 Poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U4YUryzdfU9vX3qAr38-P5lOKxLzO_h6/view?usp=sharing) & [🥇 Award](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Pec-udS-5RLdiTHsQlt03JyRTjgB-V24/view?usp=sharing)
  - [🏠 PRIME - Real Estate Market Analyzer](https://estatemonitorcore.github.io) - This is a dynamic web dashboard that visualizes 290,000 real estate transaction records on a map using Dash/Plotly, with the data stored in Supabase. [Developing]
- 🎓 Undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science, specializing in Artificial Intelligence
  - University of Utah — Salt Lake City, UT, USA Exchange Student, Computer Engineering (Aug 2025 – Dec 2025)
- 👾 Programming is something I truly enjoy, and I'm always excited to create something new


### Favorite techniques

- 📖 Interested in Large Language Model optimization, with a focus on efficient fine-tuning (LoRA, PEFT) and hallucination reduction through retrieval-augmented generation.
- 🌍 Passionate about multilingual NLP, especially in low-resource settings and cross-lingual transfer.
- 🔍 Exploring explainability in NLP models, leveraging XAI techniques to make model decisions more transparent and trustworthy.
