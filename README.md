### Self-introduction

- 🎨 I'm a passionate Machine Learning Engineer with a strong background in data statistics.
- 🤖 Deeply interested in LLM applications, currently studying about hallucination
- 🛠 Created various open-source libraries:
  - [🔍 ThreatLens](https://github.com/pxxguin/Development_of_an_Anomaly_Detection_System) - An anomaly detection system built on the NSL-KDD dataset. Classifies network traffic into normal vs. abnormal (e.g., DDoS, scans), with model explainability (ELI5, Alibi) and Django-based web interface for real-time threat monitoring.

  - [💊 Autofic](https://autofic.github.io) - A system that automatically detects security vulnerabilities in code, applies patches, and generates PR for seamless integration [📑 Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R3YJRcVCDjqAKCcpQp3u2JyK1ouGf0w6/view?usp=sharing) & [📊 Poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U4YUryzdfU9vX3qAr38-P5lOKxLzO_h6/view?usp=sharing) & [🥇 Award](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Pec-udS-5RLdiTHsQlt03JyRTjgB-V24/view?usp=sharing)
  - [🏠 PRIME](https://prime-insight.vercel.app) - This is a dynamic web dashboard that visualizes 290,000 real estate transaction records on a map using Dash/Plotly, with the data stored in Supabase. [Developing]
  - [🧑🏻‍💻 Blog](https://pxxguin.github.io) - This is the technical learning log of an aspiring developer committed to reading 100 books and 200 papers before graduation, sharing the journey to help others in the field.
- 🎓 Undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science, specializing in Artificial Intelligence
  - University of Utah — Salt Lake City, UT, USA Exchange Student, Computer Engineering (Aug 2025 – Dec 2025)
    - 📖 `CS 6350` Natural Language Processing
